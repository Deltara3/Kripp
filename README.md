# Kripp
A WIP, hopefully decent CHIP-8 and derivatives interpreter.
## DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF [CARBON](https://github.com/Deltara3/Carbon).

## Roadmap
### CHIP-8
- All opcodes implemented correctly.
- Quirks implemented.
- Wait for input opcode sometimes fails, mostly passes the test.
- Sound is still not implemented.
